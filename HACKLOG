    Initial commits were just to establish a logging system where we can
    have things broken out by category and consistent in formatting.  We've
    chosen to log to a single file by default, but you can pass in a filename
    to startFileoutput() to override that.

    I also made the choice of using UTC for all logging output.  This is to
    simplify adding logging to a database later, if that's desireable.  Postgres
    has very strange timezone support, and because of the existance of both
    time zone aware and "flat" timestamp types, it gets very confusing to
    mix them.

    The next commit was to add database support, which will be managed
    by SQLAlchemy as an ORM and Alembic as a migration tool.  The alembic
    portions are commented out, as I want to establish the changes needed
    from the default setup.

    Magic line:  SQLEngine = create_engine('postgresql://@:5432/' + DB_NAME)

    This uses the unix socket to connect to postgres, rather than tcp/ip, and
    also uses the current user.  If you want to use tcp/ip, add localhost
    in front of the required :port-number, and if you want a different user
    tack that before the @ sign.

    alembic init alembic

    This creates the initial boilerplate files, which have to be modified, so
    I will do a git commit at this point so it's easier to see what gets
    changed.
